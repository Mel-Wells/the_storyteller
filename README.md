# the_storyteller
The Storyteller is a Python and AI-powered application that generates a story based on what the user inputs. The user can choose from a variety of options such as genre, characters, location, and theme. This allows them to have a personalized story that caters to their wants. The purpose of this is to help people who have writer's block and give them an idea of where to start as far as writing goes, as well as entertain someone. For instance, the Storyteller AI can be used to aid in writing a DnD campaign or help cook up some ideas for a storyline for a video game. <br> 


## What was used
The things that were used were:
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>OpenAI library</li>
  <li>OpenAI API key</li>
</ul>

## How was it made
This project uses <i>Python</i>, <i>OpenAI Library</i>, and <i>OpenAI API Key</i> to let the user interact with an AI system to have a story written, giving them an interactive experience. While brainstorming, I asked myself how I can create an interactive experience for the user. At first, I thought maybe using the NLTK library would be sufficient. However, NLTK has some limitations. So, I went with using the API key from OpenAI. The process of creating this project took about two days while brainstorming ideas took about an hour or so of planning. I started off by using this as a reference: https://www.codedex.io/projects/generate-a-blog-with-openai and then from there went and spun up the Storyteller! 

## What went wrong?
No doubt, in a project you will come across some hiccups. One of the main issues that I was having was that when the code would execute, it would stop running after a certain point. After some troubleshooting, I concluded that it was a logic issue. Another issue I ran into while testing it was that whenever I would pick "none" for characters, it would still generate character names. So, I tweaked the code a bit to instead take "no preference" to allow the user input to match what it was doing. 

## Future Plans
Some plans I have for further expansion and improvement of this project include:
<ol>
  <li>Creating a feature that allows Storyteller AI to recommend books based on interests and needs.</li>
  <li>Create a feature that allows interactive storytelling where user input affects how the story goes. </li>
  <li>Create a nice UI for it.</li>
  <li>Possibly change the name of the AI.</li>
</ol>

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Codedex for creating the OpenAI Blog Generator project. If it wasn't for their guided project, then I would have never knew how to create this Storyteller AI. I would also like to thank Codedex for having such an awesome Python course!
